### HOW IT WORKS ‚ùì

Many people inquire via DM about how the software operates and what it discovers. In this post, I'll endeavor to explain its functionality.

1. **Mnemonic Phrases**: Each cryptocurrency wallet possesses a mnemonic phrase comprising 12 words. This phrase grants access to the wallet across various devices and crypto wallet applications, including Trust Wallet and Exodus.

2. **Private Key Generation**: The 12-word mnemonic phrase corresponds to a code that generates your Private Key, providing access to your wallet. These 12 words are automatically created by a specialized algorithm when a wallet is established in any crypto wallet application.

3. **Algorithmic Generation and Wallet Search**: We utilize a specific algorithm to generate these 12 words and subsequently examine the wallets we uncover for cryptocurrency coins.

4. **Balance Verification**: Following wallet discovery, we verify the balances of these wallets. The results often reveal significant amounts of bitcoins that have been forgotten or left dormant.

Upon identifying wallets with balances, the software enables you to import the Private Key into any compatible application, such as Trust Wallet or Exodus, and facilitate the transfer of the discovered coins to your own wallet. Subsequently, you can proceed to CASH OUT! üí∞
